***What is a class?***
A Python class is like an outline for creating a new object. An object is anything that you wish to manipulate or change while working through the code. Every time a class object is instantiated, which is when we declare a variable, a new object is initiated from scratch.

***What is an instance of a class?***
An instance of a class is an object. It is also known as a class object or class instance. As such, instantiation may be referred to as construction. Whenever values vary from one object to another, they are called instance variables. These variables are specific to a particular instance.

***Examples of object***
Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being who is described by properties like name and address, to small computer programs, such as widgets.
